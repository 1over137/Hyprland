## Goal

Our goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to
open-source software in a respectful and peaceful manner.

We value all contributions and want to make this organization and its surrounding community
a place for everyone.

As members, contributors and everyone else who may participate in the development, we strive
to keep the entire experience civil.

## Standards

Our community is made for everyone to contribute to the codebase together.

Our standards are:
 - Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone, including for their protected traits, including, but not limited to, sex, religion, race, appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, etc.
 - Do not go off-topic, do not post spam.
 - You are not required to like everybody, but you are required to treat everyone with respect.

Examples of breaking each rule respectively include:
 - Harassment, bullying or joking about someone's protected trait.
 - Posting distasteful imagery, trolling, or political discussions.
 - Treating someone as worse because of their lack of understanding of an issue.

## Enforcement

Enforcement of this CoC is done by the members of the hyprwm organization.

We, as the organization, will strive our best to keep this community civil and
following the standards outlined above.

### Reporting incidents

If you believe an incident of breaking our standards has occurred, but nobody has
taken appropriate action, you can privately contact the people responsible for dealing
with such incidents in multiple ways:

***E-Mail***
 - `vaxry[at]vaxry.net`
 - `mihai[at]fufexan.net`

***Discord***

## Enforcement Strategy

Depending on the severity of the infraction, any action from the list below may be applied.
Please keep in mind cases are reviewed on a per-case basis and members are the ultimate
deciding factor in the type of punishment.

### Correction/Edit

If your message is found to be misleading or poorly worded, a member might
edit your message.

### Warning/Deletion

If your message is found inappropriate, a member might give you a public or private warning,
and/or delete your message.

### Mute

If your message is disruptive, or you have been repeatedly violating the standards,
a member might mute (or temporairly ban) you.

### Ban

If your message is hateful, very disruptive, or other, less serious infractions are repeated
ignoring previous punishments, a member might ban you permanently.

## Scope

This CoC shall apply to all projects ran under the `hyprwm` organization and all _official_ communities
outside of GitHub.

However, it is worth noting that official communities outside of GitHub might have their own,
additional sets of rules.
